2025-03-26 14:33:23.095946<br><b>SURVEY TITLE:</b>  Alcohol Consumption<br><b>SURVEY DESCRIPTION:</b>  Genetics may influence various behaviors and effects related to alcohol. We're interested in learning about how much alcohol people consume in order to better understand these mechanisms. When answering the following questions, please do not include non-alcoholic beverages in your responses. <br><br> The average time needed to complete this survey is 5-10 minutes.

    Why am I seeing this document?
</h3> <p>
    This document serves as an addition to our general research consent form, and provides
    additional information specific to this particular survey. The general research consent
    form, which can be viewed <a href="https://www.23andme.com/about/consent">here</a>, includes a more complete summary of the risks and
    benefits of participating in our research.
</p> <p>
    The survey you are about to view is part of a research project to look for genetic
    correlates of alcohol use. This topic may be highly personal and difficult to discuss.
    Answering some of the survey questions may cause emotional discomfort. Similar to
    other, less sensitive surveys, you may receive information about the topic at the end of
    the survey, including general comparisons between your answers and those of other
    23andMe participants. When other participants view general comparisons, your
    answers may be included if you choose to answer. In addition, scientific publication
    of genetic associations with specific behaviors or personal characteristics may change
    the way those behaviors or characteristics are perceived by the public. In some cases,
    such publication may affect the way you or groups to which you belong are perceived.
    The survey will most likely take between 5 and 20 minutes to complete.

    As described in our research consent form, your self-reported information (stripped of
    any personally identifying information) may be shared in aggregate with external
    organizations, but your individual information will never be shared with third parties
