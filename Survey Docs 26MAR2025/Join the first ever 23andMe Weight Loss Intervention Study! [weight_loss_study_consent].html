2025-03-26 14:33:34.740685<br><b>SURVEY TITLE:</b>  Join the first ever 23andMe Weight Loss Intervention Study!<br><b>SURVEY DESCRIPTION:</b>  Join our landmark study that aims to understand the role of genetics and behavior in weight loss.<br><br> Have you ever noticed that some people seem to lose weight more easily than others? Have you ever wondered if a low-carbohydrate diet, a low-fat diet, or exercise-only approach to losing weight might be more effective for you?<br><br> We're interested in finding out whether genetics plays a role in answering these questions.<br><br> And we need your help.
<br><br><br><strong>[1] PAGE:  Study Information Page</strong><br><br>1. <p>
   This New Year, we want to lose weight with you, while better understanding
   the relationship between genetics, different diet and exercise approaches,
   and weight loss. We are looking to recruit committed 23andMe participants
   who are willing to change aspects of their lifestyle. Our scientists have
   designed a 12-week study that we would love for you to be a part of.

    <b>FAQ</b><br><br>
</h4> <p>
   <b>Can you tell me more about the Weight Loss Intervention survey questions?</b><br>Our first survey will include questions about your food preferences and cravings, your diet, physical activity, sleep, and stress. Every week, we will follow up with questions about your diet, physical activity and how you are feeling about the intervention. We will also ask about your current weight and inches around your waist and hips.
</p> <p>
   <b>What will I learn about in my weight loss advice?</b><br>We'll provide recommendations to help you lose weight, which may include teaching you about portion sizes and foods to eat, tips for handling cravings, etc. You will also learn best practices for improving sleep, reducing stress and increasing physical activity.
</p> <p>
   <b>Will people at 23andMe be losing weight with me?</b><br>Yes! Eligible employees at 23andMe will be participating in the trial and experiencing it with you.
</p> <p>
   <b>Will there be any interactive components to the study?</b><br>Yes. We also offer you 23andMe participant forums designed specifically for the intervention to help you better engage with the content, connect with other participants, and support you in your weight loss journey.
</p> <p>
  <b>How many people will participate in this study?</b><br>Our goal is to enroll approximately 100,000 participants.
</p> <p>
   <b>How long will it take me to complete surveys?</b><br>Our baseline survey will take most people 8-10 minutes to complete. Our weekly survey will take most people approximately 5 minutes to complete. Our completion of intervention survey should take most people 1-2 minutes. The 6 and 12 month follow up surveys should take most people 5-6 minutes.
</p> <p>
   <b>What if I commit to changing my behavior but I am unable to follow through?</b><br>We would like to know about that too! Sometimes change is hard, and by continuing to complete surveys, we may be able to understand why certain changes are especially difficult for certain people.
</p> <p>
   <b>Do I get anything for participating?</b><br>Yes! In addition to receiving diet and lifestyle recommendations, you will earn exclusive results based on our study findings. In order to receive these findings, we ask you to commit to a lifestyle change and answer the final intervention survey at week 12.
</p> <p>
   <b>What if I change my mind during the study and I no longer want to participate?</b><br>You can withdraw from research at any time by changing your consent status in your Account Settings.

</h2> <h3>
    <b>Why is this research study being done?</b>
</h3> <p>
   The science behind personalized diet and exercise recommendations is in very early stages.
   At 23andMe, we are committed to quality science and providing you with information you can
   trust based on this science. This study is designed to generate new data we can use to
   understand more about the genetics of weight loss, and the connection between genetics and behavior on weight loss.<br><br>
   Your data may assist 23andMe researchers in activities including, but not limited to:
<ul>
     <ul>
          <li>Performing analyses to determine how much genetics play a role in weight loss</li>
          <li>Developing recommendations on whether an individual is likely to lose more weight on a low-carb, low-fat, or exercise-focused approach based on genetic and non-genetic predictors</li>
          <li>Evaluating which characteristics and behaviors have the biggest impact on losing weight</li>
     </ul>
</ul> </p> <p>
    We are recruiting current 23andMe research participants to take part in this research.
    Taking part in this study is completely voluntary. If you choose not to participate,
    there will be no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled.
</p> <h3>

</p> <h3>
    <b>What am I agreeing to if I consent to this part of the research?</b>
</h3> <p>
    This form describes the research activities that are part of the 23andMe Weight Loss Intervention Study.<br><br>
    If you agree to participate in this study, you agree:
<ul>
     <ul>
          <li>That you meet the eligibility criteria specified above</li>
          <li>Commit to changing your diet and/or physical activity for 12 weeks to attempt to lose weight. You'll make one of the following lifestyle changes:</li><br>
              <ul>
                  <li>Focus on reducing carbohydrate intake, and staying physically active</li>
                  <li>Focus on increasing fiber in the diet, lowering saturated fat intake, and staying physically active</li>
                  <li>Focus on increasing the intensity and duration of physical activity</li>
              </ul>
          <br>
          <li>To complete surveys on the 23andMe website that will include questions about your weight, diet, physical activity, sleep, stress, lifestyle, and other habits. The surveys should take about 5-10 minutes on average.</li>
          <li>We may also invite you to contribute additional data through our mobile app. This activity is voluntary and if invited, we will provide additional information and consent form.</li>
     </ul>
</ul> <br>
    If you decide to be in the study you will be in one of two arms: either the participant choice arm or the randomization arm.
    This means that we will let you choose which of the interventions you will follow, or we'll randomly assign you to an intervention
    (like flipping a coin).  Then you'll follow that plan for 12 weeks.  Over the course of the 12 weeks, we'll send you tips and advice
    about your intervention and other topics related to weight loss, general health and well-being.  You'll also have the opportunity to
    chat with 23andMe scientists about this study in our forums.
<br><br>
    The 23andMe Weight Loss Intervention is open-ended: the structured intervention will last approximately 12 weeks,
    but we encourage you to keep up a healthy diet, physical activity, and other lifestyle behaviors beyond the duration
    of the study. We may follow-up with a voluntary check-in survey after 6 and 12 months. At this time, you may receive
    an email update or see an announcement when you sign in to your account.
</p> <h3>
    <b>How do you keep my data protected and confidential?</b>
</h3> <p>
    23andMe uses a range of physical, technical, and administrative procedures to protect the privacy of your personal information,
    including your genetic data and your survey responses. The 23andMe researchers who have access to your survey responses
    and genetic data do not have access to Registration Information (name, address, email address, user ID,
    password, or credit card) of customers. Although 23andMe cannot provide a 100% guarantee that your data will be safe,
    23andMe policies and procedures minimize the chance that a data breach could take place.<br><br>
    Certain regulatory agencies and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) may also need access to
    study records in case of an audit or for monitoring.
</p> <h3>
    <b>What are the potential benefits and risks?</b>
</h3> <p>
    <b>Benefits:</b> The lifestyle changes associated with this intervention may result in weight loss,
    with associated favorable changes in blood glucose, lipids, and other cardiovascular and/or diabetes
    risk factors. After you've completed the 12th week of data collection, we will share study findings with you,
    which may result in increases in knowledge about the role of genetics and non-genetic factors in weight loss.
    The study findings will be shared after we have completed our analysis. By reviewing the bi-weekly advice, you may learn
    about new dietary, physical activity, sleep and stress management strategies that may improve your general
    health/well-being.<br><br>

    <b>Risks:</b> The lifestyle changes associated with modifying your diet and/or physical activity
    patterns may be uncomfortable. In addition, it may be difficult to follow through with the lifestyle
    change that you committed to, which may cause stress.<br><br> There are also risks associated with
    changing your diet or increasing your physical activity. You can reduce these risks by withdrawing from
    this study at any time.<br><br>The risks that may result from changing your diet are:
<ul>
     <ul>
          <li>Hunger, nausea and/or abdominal discomfort
          <li>Constipation and/or diarrhea
          <li>Halitosis (bad breath)
          <li>General weakness, fatigue and/or dizziness
          <li>Mood changes
          <li>Muscle cramps and/or headache
          <li>Changes in nutritional status (whether you are getting the right types and amounts of nutrients)
     </ul>
</ul> </p> <p>
    The risks that may result from increased physical activity are:
<ul>
     <ul>
          <li>Muscle cramps
          <li>Back and/or knee pain
     </ul>
</ul> </p> <p>
    It is recommended that you talk with your doctor before starting any new exercise routine. You should seek
    medical attention if you experience any of the following during or after engaging in physical activity:<br>
<ul>
     <ul>
          <li>Pain or pressure in your chest, arms, throat, jaw or back
          <li>Nausea or vomiting
          <li>The feeling of your heart fluttering or racing very fast
          <li>Feeling dizzy or faint
          <li>A physical injury
     </ul>
</ul> </p> <p>
    In the event of an emergency, <b>dial 911 immediately</b>. If you require emergency care, be sure to tell the
    emergency care provider about your participation in this study.<br><br>
    There is a very small chance that someone with access to the research data or results could expose personal information
    about you. 23andMe has policies and procedures in place to minimize the chance of such an event (as described in the
    "How do you keep my data protected and confidential?" section of this document).
