    Consent Document
</h2> <p>
    This consent document provides additional information relevant to the 23andMe Research Initiatives and serves as a supplement to our full <a href="https://www.23andme.com/about/consent/">consent</a> document, which can be viewed on the 23andMe website.
</p> <h3>
    What is this part of the research about?
</h3> <p>
    In addition to its other studies, 23andMe is conducting targeted research on the impact of compensation on survey data quality. We are recruiting people from outside and/or inside the 23andMe customer base to take part in this research. The purpose of this is to find out how to improve data quality as well as the research participant experience.
</p> <h3>
    How do you participate in the study?
</h3> <p>
    You can take part in this study if you are willing to have your Genetic & Self-Reported Information, such as survey answers, used in research on human health and disease as well as in research on the impact of compensation on survey-taking behavior. There is no cost for participating in this study. Participation in this study is open to adults aged 18 years and older.
</p> <h3>
    What am I agreeing to if I consent to this part of the research?
</h3> <p>
    You have already agreed to let 23andMe researchers use your Genetic & Self-Reported Information for research, as described in the main 23andMe Research <a href="https://www.23andme.com/about/consent/">consent</a>.
</p> <p>
    If you additionally agree to this consent document, you agree
</p> <ul>
  • to complete surveys on the 23andMe website regarding health, behavior, ancestry and other IRB-approved research topics, and <br>
  • to receive compensation types and value amounts that may differ from those offered to and received by other study participants
<h3>
    What are the additional potential benefits and risks?
</h3> <p>
    <strong>Additional benefits:</strong> Your participation will allow scientists to study and analyze more thoroughly data on compensation and survey-taking behavior. This may lead to improvements in the research participant experience in future 23andMe studies.
</p> <p>
    <strong>Additional risks:</strong> Your participation will mean that you may receive a different type or amount of compensation for research than another participant in the same study. It is possible that you could discover differences in compensation, such as through community forum posts or another family member's participation in the same study. This could potentially lead you to feel unfairly treated, embarrassed, or uncomfortable.
</p> <h3>
    Do I have any alternatives? Can I withdraw from this study?
</h3> <p>
    Your alternative is not to participate in this study. If you are a current 23andMe customer, this will have no effect on your access to your Genetic Information or to the 23andMe® Personal Genome Service. Choosing not to participate in this study will have no effect on your ability to participate in 23andMe Research unrelated to studies of participant compensation (see the main 23andMe consent document for details).
</p> <p>
    At any time, you may choose to withdraw all or some of your Genetic & Self-Reported information from this 23andMe study by changing your consent status within the 23andMe <a href="https://www.23andme.com/user/edit/privacy/">"Settings" page</a>.
</p> <p>
    If you withdraw from the study, you will still be allowed full access to your Genetic Information and to the Personal Genome Service. 23andMe will prevent your study data from being used in new 23andMe research occurring after 30 days from receipt of your request. Any research on your data that has been performed or published prior to this date will not be reversed, undone, or withdrawn.
