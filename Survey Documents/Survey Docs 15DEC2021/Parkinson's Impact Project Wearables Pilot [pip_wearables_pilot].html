We hope to learn more about how wearable technology can enhance research into early signs of Parkinson's disease.  This survey is designed to understand your experience with the wearable device we mailed to you, to identify ways in which we can improve this research experience, and to understand the value of the data derived from these devices. <br><br> Estimated time to complete: 3-5 minutes.
