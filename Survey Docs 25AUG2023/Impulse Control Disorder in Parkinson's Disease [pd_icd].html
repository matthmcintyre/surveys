2023-08-25 12:32:30.833966<br><b>SURVEY TITLE:</b>  Impulse Control Disorder in Parkinson's Disease<br><b>SURVEY DESCRIPTION:</b>  Impulse control disorders (ICD) are a potentially serious aspect of Parkinson's disease (PD), but the exact cause of ICD in PD is unknown. The following PD ICD survey will help us investigate this, and how genetics and other factors affect the risk of developing ICD. The highly personal and sensitive nature of the topics in the survey require a survey-specific consent.<br><br>
This survey should take 5-7 minutes to complete.<br><hr>

   Why am I seeing this document?
</h3> <p>
   This document serves as an addition to the research consent forms that you
   have previously accepted, and provides additional information specific to
   this particular survey. The research consent forms that you have previously
   accepted, which can be viewed <a target="_blank" href="https://you.23andme.com/user/">here</a>,
   include a more complete summary of the risks and benefits of participating in our research.
</p> <p>
   The survey you are about to view is part of a research project to examine
   the prevalence of impulse control disorders among research participants
   with Parkinson's disease and how genetic and other factors influence this.
   The survey contains questions concerning experience with impulse control
   disorder-related behaviors such as excessive gambling, sex addiction, excessive shopping,
   overeating and use of Parkinson's disease medications. In addition,
   there are questions dealing with abuse of alcohol, and prescription and
   illicit drugs. These topics might be highly personal and difficult to
   discuss. Answering some of the survey questions may cause emotional
   discomfort. In addition, scientific publication of genetic associations with
   specific behaviors or personal characteristics may change the way those behaviors
   or characteristics are perceived by the public. In some cases, such publication may
   affect the way you or groups to which you belong are perceived.
</p> <p>
   Participation in this research is completely voluntary, and you may skip
   any questions that you want and stop answering this survey at any point, for
   any reason. Please note that due to the sensitive nature of this topic,
   persons under the age of 18 are not eligible for this study.
