<br><br><br><strong>[1] PAGE:  Study Information Page</strong><br><br>1. <h4>
    <b>Here's how it works:</b>
</h4> <br> <ul>
    <li><b>Enroll today:</b> We will ask you to consent to participate in the study and take a set of surveys about your current sleep experience.</b></li><br>
    <li><b>First 2 weeks <i>starting the last week of September</i>:</b></li><br>
        <ul>
            <li>We will ask you to fill out sleep diary surveys for two weeks.</li><br>
        </ul>
    <li><b>Next 4 weeks <i>ending early November</i>:</b></li><br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Commit to a change:</b> We will randomly assign you to a study group and ask you to change your behavior for 4 weeks.</li><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>One study group focuses on daytime changes, like drinking less caffeine, exercising more or taking less naps.</li><br>
                    <li>The other study group focuses on nighttime changes, like having a consistent bedtime, reducing screen time before bed and practicing mindfulness before bed.</li><br>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Answer surveys:</b> We will ask you to answer surveys to see how your sleep quality changes over these 4 weeks.</li><br>
        </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
<p>
   <b>Why your help is so important</b><br>This is the first study in which 23andMe is asking research participants to change their behavior for a period of time and log the outcomes. This can unlock a whole new range of possible discoveries. We hypothesize that different strategies for improving sleep may work better for certain individuals depending on genetics and other lifestyle factors. Understanding these connections could lead to new insights that could help people improve their sleep quality.
</p> <p>
   <b>Who can enroll:</b><br><br>
   <span class="indent">Individuals who meet all of the following criteria:</span>
   <ul>
   <ul>
        <li>Are experiencing some insomnia, expressed as trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, resulting in broad dissatisfaction with sleep quality or quantity (but not experiencing other sleeping disorder(s), such as jet lag, parasomnia, narcolepsy, hypersomnia, etc.)</li>

    <b>FAQ</b><br><br>
</h4> <p>
   <b>Can you tell me more about the Sleep Study survey questions?</b><br> Surveys will mostly include questions about your sleep in the past 24 hours or in the past week. We will also ask about your sleep quality in the past month and lifestyle habits.
</p> <p>
   <b>How many people will participate in this study?</b><br>Our goal is to enroll 10,000 participants.
</p> <p>
   <b>What if I commit to changing my behavior but I am unable to follow through?</b><br>We would like to know about that too! Sometimes change is hard and by continuing to complete surveys, we may be able to understand why certain changes are especially difficult for certain people.
</p> <p>
   <b>Do I get anything for participating?</b><br>At the end of the study, we will let you know what we learned. This study may even help us develop new genetic reports on how to improve sleep quality.
</p> <p>
   <b>What if I change my mind during the study and I no longer want to participate?</b><br>You can withdraw from research at any time by changing your consent status in your Account Settings. Email us at <a href="mailto:sleep-study@23andme.com">sleep-study@23andme.com</a> and we can help you.
</p> <p>
  <b>Who can I contact if I have more questions about the Sleep Study?</b><br>We are here to answer your questions. Email us at <a href="mailto:sleep-study@23andme.com">sleep-study@23andme.com</a> and we will get back to you within three business days.

    Consent Document for Sleep Study<br><br>
</h2> <p>
    This consent document provides information relevant to the Sleep Study.
</p> <h3>
    <b>Why is this research study being done?</b>
</h3> <p>
    This research study aims to learn more about the relationship between genetics,
    behavior, and sleep quality. Previous research has shown that specific behaviors
    may improve sleep quality for those that have trouble sleeping.
    However, scientists need to know more about how genetics and environment affect
    the way those with trouble sleeping respond to a given behavioral change.
</p> <p>
    Your data may assist 23andMe researchers in activities including, but not limited to:
    developing and validating new strategies to predict and prevent sleep trouble.
</p> <p>
    We are recruiting current 23andMe research participants to take part in this research,
    including those who have reported that they have trouble sleeping as well as those
    who have not. Taking part in this study is completely voluntary. If you chose not to participate,
    there will be no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled.
</p> <h3>
    <b>What am I agreeing to if I consent to this part of the research?</b>
</h3> <p>
    This form describes the research activities that are part of the 23andMe Sleep Study.
</p> <p>
    If you agree to participate in this study, you agree:
<ul>
    <li> To complete surveys on the 23andMe website that will include questions about your sleep, lifestyle, and other habits.
    The surveys should take about 10 minutes on average.</li><br>
    <li> Commit to changing at least one thing in your lifestyle for four weeks to attempt to improve
    your sleep. You will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms, daytime or nighttime.
    The daytime arm includes changes like drinking less caffeine, exercising more, or taking
    fewer naps. The nighttime arm includes changes like having a consistent bedtime,
    reducing screen time before bed, and engaging in meditation or mindfulness.
    We will ask you to make a change corresponding to the study arm you are assigned that makes sense
    for your lifestyle. We will ask you to tell us beforehand what you plan
    to change and then keep us informed of how well you are able to stick to that plan.</li><br>
    <li> We may also invite you to contribute additional data through our mobile app.  This activity is voluntary
    and if invited, we will provide additional information and consent.</li>
</ul> </p> <p>
    The 23andMe Sleep Study is open-ended: we expect initial study involvement to last approximately six weeks,
    but data analysis will be ongoing and we may add new surveys or features in the future.
    If new surveys or features are added, you may receive an email update or see an announcement
    when you sign in to your account.
</p> <h3>
    <b>How do you keep my data protected and confidential?</b>
</h3> <p>
    23andMe uses a range of physical, technical, and administrative procedures to protect the privacy
    of your personal information, including your genetic data and your survey responses.
    The 23andMe researchers who have access to your survey responses and genetic data do
    not have access to Registration Information (name, address, email address, user ID,
    password, or credit card) of customers. Although 23andMe cannot provide a 100% guarantee
    that your data will be safe, 23andMe policies and procedures minimize the chance that
    a data breach could take place.
</p> <p>
    Certain regulatory agencies may also need access to study records, such as the Institutional
    Review Board (IRB) in case of an audit or for monitoring.
</p> <h3>
    <b>What are the potential benefits and risk?</b>
</h3> <p>
    <b>Benefits:</b> There may be no direct benefit of participating.
    There is a chance that this research will contribute to an increase in knowledge about sleep
    and/or methods for improving sleep quality.
</p> <p>
    <b>Risks:</b> The lifestyle changes that you make as part of this study may
    cause you discomfort. For example, withdrawing caffeine, increased exercise, or reduced
    naps may cause headaches or drowsiness. Having a consistent bedtime and reducing screen
    time may cause scheduling changes that affect your ability to participate in social situations
    and other enjoyable activities. In addition, it may be difficult to follow through with the lifestyle
    change that you committed to, which may cause stress. You can mitigate these risks by withdrawing
    from this study at any time.
