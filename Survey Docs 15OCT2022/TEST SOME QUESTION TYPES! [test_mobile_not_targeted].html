    Why am I seeing this document?
</h3> <p>
    <strong>The survey you are about to view contains topics that some people may see as sensitive.</strong>
    The survey you are about to view is part of a research project to look for genetic correlates of response
    to common antidepressant medications. The survey contains questions concerning sexual desire and sexual
    function, which some of these medications may affect. These topics may be highly personal and difficult to
    discuss. Answering some of the survey questions may cause emotional discomfort. In addition, scientific
    publication of genetic associations with specific behaviors or personal characteristics may change the
    way those behaviors or characteristics are perceived by the public. In some cases, such publication may
    affect the way you or groups to which you belong are perceived.
</p> <p>
    Participation in this research is completely voluntary, and you may stop answering this survey at any
    point, for any reason. <strong>Please note that due to the sensitive nature of this topic, persons under
