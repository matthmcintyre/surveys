    23andMe uses a range of physical, technical, and administrative procedures to protect the privacy of your Personal Information, including your Genetic Information and Self-Reported Information (e.g. survey or interview responses). 23andMe study investigators aim to minimize the chances of your information being inadvertently disclosed or accessed by following various policies and procedures, including the ones listed below:

  • Interview responses will be temporarily stored on password-protected servers. Once interview data collection is complete, the data will be transferred and permanently stored in a secure research computing environment. <br>
  • If 23andMe, 23andMe research collaborators, or future researchers publish data (for example in a peer-reviewed journal, blog post or other medium), only data summaries, de-identified interview responses, or combined data from many individuals, will be published. <br>
  • All 23andMe employees are trained on how to work with human research participants.  In addition, all 23andMe study investigators are trained on how to conduct research responsibly. <br>
