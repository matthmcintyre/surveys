2022-10-15 12:05:23.801176<br><b>SURVEY TITLE:</b>  Validation of Step Count for Sleep Phenotypes<br><b>SURVEY DESCRIPTION:</b>  Thank you for helping to validate the use of step count data to derive sleep  phenotypes, such as your amount of sleep.  The study will last 30 days. You will receive an email each day asking you to log in and answer questions about the last time you  slept.  It's OK if you don't answer every day, but try to answer as often as possible.  The first survey should take around 5 minutes, and subsequent surveys only  a few minutes.
