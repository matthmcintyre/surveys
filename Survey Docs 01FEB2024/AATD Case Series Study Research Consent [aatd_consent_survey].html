    How will my data be used?
</h3> <p>
    Information you share will be used to understand how people use and benefit from the 23andMe AATD Genetic Health Risk report. We may share our findings from this study with the public, including <strong>anonymous</strong> quotes from the interviews we conduct. Any findings or quotes we publish <strong>will not</strong> include your name or any other personally identifying information.
</p> <h3>
    How do you keep my data protected and confidential for this study?
</h3> <p>
    23andMe uses a range of physical, technical, and administrative procedures to protect the privacy of your Personal Information, including your Genetic Information and Self-Reported Information (e.g. survey or interview responses). 23andMe study investigators aim to minimize the chances of a breach by following various policies and procedures, including the ones listed below: 
</p> <ul>
  • Your name and contact information may be used to communicate with you but are not analyzed in combination with your interview data or your Genetic Information. <br>
  • Interview data will be temporarily stored on password-protected servers. Once interview data collection is complete, the data will be transferred and permanently stored in a secure research computing environment. <br>
  • If 23andMe, 23andMe research collaborators, or future researchers publish data (for example in a peer-reviewed journal, blog post or other medium), only data summaries, de-identified interview responses, or combined data from many individuals, will be published. <br>
  • All 23andMe employees are trained on how to work with human research participants.  In addition, all 23andMe study investigators are trained on how to conduct research responsibly. <br>
</ul>             <h3>

The procedures for this study do not involve more than the minimal risks. There may be additional risks to participation that are currently unforeseeable.
