Feel free to enjoy coffee, tea (caffeinated or decaf), or water in the morning and throughout the day. They're almost calorie free (coffee has 1 calorie per cup, and tea has 2), and long-term studies show that coffee and tea are associated with lower risks of chronic diseases. It's best to avoid adding sugar, but a splash of half-and-half is okay

  In general, on this diet you'll limit grains to one serving per day, choosing either:
  <ul>
     <li>A slice of whole grain bread (1 slice = 1 serving); <b>or</b> </li>
     <li>A ready-to-eat cereal (3/4 cup = 1 serving) that lists whole grain, wheat bran or whole grain wheat as the first ingredient; <b>or</b></li>

  So how much physical activity should you aim for? Well, that depends on your weight loss goal and how active you currently are. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends 150-250 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity for modest weight loss. Greater amounts (i.e.  greater than 250 minutes per week) provide clinically significant weight loss.
</p>
<br>{CONTINUE BUTTON}<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[CONCEPT: wli_week_1_exercise_1]<br><br><br>17. <p>
  Let's break that down:
  <ul>
     <li><b>Aerobic activity.</b> Aim for at least 150 minutes a week (e.g., 30 minutes, 5 times a week) of moderate aerobic activity, <b>or</b> 75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity. Moderate activity includes brisk walking, skating, volleyball, or mowing the lawn. You'll know you're in the "moderate intensity" range if you can talk but not sing while you're active. Vigorous activity includes running and aerobic dancing — you're in the "vigorous" activity range if you have to stop for a breath every few words.<br></li>
     <li>You can also do a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. And it's best to spread this activity out over the course of the week, not cram it all into one trip to the gym.<br></li>
     <li><b>Strength training.</b> Aim to strength train at least twice a week. Consider free weights, weight machines or activities that use your own body weight — like rock climbing or heavy gardening.<br></li>
  </ul>   
</p>
<br>{CONTINUE BUTTON}<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[CONCEPT: wli_week_1_exercise_2]<br><br><br>18. <p>
  If you're not used to doing this much physical activity, it may seem like a lot! It's okay to work towards these goals by starting small (e.g., with 10 minutes per day or less of light-intensity aerobic activity), and increasing the duration and intensity as you get stronger. 
</p> <p>
  <b>Stay hydrated & control cravings</b>. Drink plenty of water throughout the day, especially after physical activity. Research shows that drinking water before meals can also reduce appetite and help with weight loss.
</p>
<br>{CONTINUE BUTTON}<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[CONCEPT: wli_week_1_exercise_3]<br><br><br>19. <h4>
  How should I decide which kinds of physical activity to try?</b>
</h4> <p>
  <br><b>Would you rather exercise solo or in a group?</b> Group exercise is a good fit if you are outgoing or looking to meet new people, if you find solo exercise boring, or if you have a hard time staying motivated when you exercise alone. Solo exercise is a good match if you want to work out at home or on your own schedule. Try out different ways of getting active and see what fits your style — the best exercise is the one you'll do!
</p> <p>
  <b>Choose activities that accommodate your health issues.</b> If you have a history of athletic injuries or existing health problems, you may want to talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise routine. Most medical conditions won't rule out exercise completely, but certain types of exercise may be a better fit for you.

  Losing weight isn't easy, but getting clear about why you are making lifestyle changes can help you stay on track. We did a survey of 23andMe employees and asked about their motivation for losing weight. Here's what they said:
</p> <p>
  <strong>
    <li>
      22% want to feel healthier
    </li>
    <li>
      22% want to change their appearance
    </li>
    <li>
      18% want to improve their confidence, mood or energy level
    </li>
    <li>
      5% want to improve their stamina and physical activity performance
    </li>
    <li>
      33% listed other reasons
    </li>
  </strong>
</p> <p>
  The "other" category includes a variety of reasons — from controlling blood sugar, cholesterol, or blood pressure, to getting in shape for an upcoming event (a wedding), to keeping up with kids and dogs!
</p> <p>
  So, what motivated you to join the study? Keep your goal in mind over these next 12 weeks to help you maintain your lifestyle change — sticking with it is the biggest predictor of success!

  Hi, welcome to week 5 of the 23andMe Weight Loss Intervention Study!
</h4> <p>  
  Have you ever tried to lose weight, but you didn't quite reach your goal? We asked 23andMe employees what helped them the most when they tried to lose weight. The number one answer? Getting social support from friends and family to help them stay on track.
</p> <p>
  Several studies have shown that social factors can have a big impact on weight because healthy and unhealthy behaviors spread through social networks. When you have more social connections who are trying to lose weight with you, you're likely to exercise more and lose more weight overall.

  Week 7: Physical Activity
</h4> <p>
  You've made it to Week 7! Congratulations, and thank you for your participation!
</p> <p>
  This week, we'll talk more about physical activity.
  First, we'll share some insights about physical activity that we gained from data shared by 23andMe research participants.
  Then, we'll introduce some workout routines that can be done from home without any special equipment.
</p>
<br>{CONTINUE BUTTON}<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[CONCEPT: wli_week_7_content_expectations_1]<br><br><br>34. <p>
  We asked 23andMe research participants how often they engage in moderate or vigorous exercise, and nearly 600,000 people have responded so far!
  In the chart below, we plotted the number of minutes spent exercising per week against age, for male (M) and female (F) research participants. Here's the picture we see:
</p>
<br>{CONTINUE BUTTON}<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[CONCEPT: wli_week_7_content_expectations_2]<br><br><br>35. <p>
  Looking at the chart we can see a few trends related to physical activity:
</p> <ul>
    • Among survey participants, male participants reported more time spent per week on moderate or vigorous physical activity than women did. There was an average of about 15-40 more minutes per week in every age group. 
</ul> <ul>
    • Among survey participants, younger people on average reported more time spent per week on moderate or vigorous physical activity than older people did.
      On average, people in their 20's report 60 more minutes of physical activity per week than people in their 80's do. 
</ul>

   Now that we know that age and sex influence physical activity levels, what about other factors?
   We wanted to know which US states tend to be the most active, so we used the same statistic as before, average weekly active minutes, and looked at how it changes from state to state. The dark green color shows the states that spend more time engaging in physical activity, and the light green shows states that have the lowest levels. 
   We found that states in the the Rocky Mountain region, including Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah, have high levels of physical activity. 
   Other states that report high levels of physical activity were Alaska, Hawaii, South Carolina and Maryland.

  Equipment-free Exercises:
</h4> <p>
  Below are 3 equipment-free exercises that can be considered as additions to a regular physical activity routine.
  Remember, a healthcare professional can help determine if these or other new exercises are appropriate for you.
</p>
<br>{CONTINUE BUTTON}<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[CONCEPT: wli_week_7_content_expectations_5]<br><br><br>38. <p>
  Lie with your back on the floor and knees bent at 90 degrees. 
  Keeping your feet flat on the floor, lift your hips upwards by pushing against the floor with your heels. 
  The final position should result in a straight line (aka a 'bridge') from the back of your shoulders to your knees. 
</p> <p>
  Slowly lower your hips to the floor and repeat.
  A typical routine might include two sets of ten bridges, two or three times a week.
  This exercise uses the powerful muscles in your buttocks and backs of the thighs, and can improve hip mobility and lower back strength. 
</p>

  This exercise requires walking shoes and involves natural arm swinging while walking 
  in place at an easy pace.
  Marching in place is a low-impact, aerobic activity that can be done at home at times when 
  sitting is common, such as while reading or watching television, or during commercial breaks.

  This is a great core exercise: the forearm plank.
</p> <p>
 To do it, forearms are placed on the ground with elbows directly below the shoulders so that 
 the forearms are parallel to the body and about a shoulders-width apart. 
 Then a straight line can be imagined from the shoulders down to the heels. 
 A successful plank is maintaining that straight line relationship from shoulders, to hips, to heels.
</p> <p>
 Adjusting foot positioning may be necessary to help maintain that straight line position.
 For a variation of this exercise, knees can be placed on the ground.
 A typical routine (2-3 times per week) involves holding the plank position for 30 seconds at a time,
 working up to 1 minute as your core gets stronger.

  You don't need scientific studies to tell you that it's hard to stick with a diet.
  But researchers are also searching for answers to questions like, why is it so difficult? And how can we make it easier?
</p>
<br>{CONTINUE BUTTON}<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[CONCEPT: wli_week_9_content_disclaimer_1]<br><br><br>43. <p>
   Let's talk about how hunger works. 
   Your body uses two hormones called <i>ghrelin</i> and <i>leptin</i> to control hunger. 
   Ghrelin is known as "the hunger hormone" because it makes you want to eat, and leptin is "the satiety hormone" because it tells you to stop eating as you're getting full.
</p> <p>
   The levels of leptin and ghrelin in your body depend on things you'd expect, like the time since your last meal, what kind of food you ate, and how active you've been. 
   But it turns out those hormone levels also depend on other factors, like how much sleep you got last night, and how much stress you're feeling.
</p>
<br>{CONTINUE BUTTON}<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[CONCEPT: wli_week_9_content_expectations_1]<br><br><br>44. <p>
  When you don't get enough sleep, ghrelin levels are high, which makes you feel more hungry. 
  And even after eating a healthy meal, your leptin levels stay low — meaning you don't feel satisfied, and you might still be hungry when you shouldn't be.
</p> <p>
  Stress can have similar effects on hunger hormones.
  One study found that women who were under social stress had higher ghrelin levels and lower leptin levels than women who were under less stress. 
  In other words, their bodies were sending more "I'm hungry" signals and fewer "I'm full" signals. 
</p> <p>
  What does this mean? 
  It means that keeping up with a healthy diet isn't just about willpower, it's also about taking good care of yourself.
  It means that <b> getting enough sleep </b> and <b> keeping your stress levels low </b> are important because you want your body to work with you — not against you — as you try to lose weight. 
  More sleep and less stress means that you're likely to be less hungry, less often.

  Here are a few tips for getting a good night's sleep:
</p> <li>
  Go to bed and wake up around the same time every day.
</li> <li>
 Don't use your bed for any activities other than sleep and sex.
</li> <li>
 Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and comfortable while you sleep.
</li>
<br>{CONTINUE BUTTON}<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[CONCEPT: wli_week_9_content_expectations_3]<br><br><br>46. <p>
  And here are some tips to help lower stress levels:
</p> <li>
  Take a break. Schedule 10-30 minutes each day to unplug: try taking a bath, doing yoga, writing, reading a book, or meditating.
</li> <li>
 Spend time with supportive family and friends — in person, over the phone, or online.
</li> <li>
 Exercise regularly! Being active can improve your energy level, mood, and physical health.
</li> <br> <p>
  Remember, you should consider consulting a healthcare professional before making any major lifestyle changes.

   There's a lot of buzz about the role of genetics in weight loss, but scientific research in this field is still in very early stages.
</p> <p>
   What does that mean? 
   Well, most studies have looked for genetic associations with <b> weight </b> or body mass index (BMI), but not with <b> weight loss </b> specifically.
   And the genetic variants associated with weight might be different from those associated with weight loss.
</p> <p>
   Other studies have examined a small number of genetic variants when exploring the complicated relationships between diet, exercise, and weight.
   Often times, their findings aren't confirmed by later studies. 
   But something as complex as weight loss is likely to depend on many different genetic factors, not just a handful.
</p>
<br>{CONTINUE BUTTON}<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[CONCEPT: wli_week_11_content_expectations_1]<br><br><br>50. <p>
   So, how can we discover genetic variants associated with weight loss in this study?
   By using a much more powerful scientific approach, called <b>'GWAS'</b>, which stands for genome-wide association study. 
</p> <p>
   A GWAS measures hundreds of thousands of genetic variants to find out which ones are most strongly associated with weight loss. 
   That's a big improvement over looking at just a few genetic variants!
</p>
<br>{CONTINUE BUTTON}<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[CONCEPT: wli_week_11_content_expectations_2]<br><br><br>51. <p>
   Why hasn't anyone performed a GWAS of weight loss before? 
   Usually, a study needs to have a lot of participants in order to uncover genetic variants using GWAS.
   And so far, studies about weight loss and genetics have been too small.
</p> <p>
   At 23andMe, we're excited to be leading this breakthrough weight loss intervention study, using GWAS to discover genetic associations with weight loss.
   And we're happy that you're part of it!
