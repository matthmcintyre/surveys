    Consent Document for the Cold Pressor Test (CPT)
</h2> <p>
    This document is an addition to our general research consent document. It provides
    information specific to this particular research activity. For a more complete 
    explanation of the 23andMe research program, refer to our general
    <a href="https://www.23andme.com/about/consent">research consent document</a>.
</p> <h3>
    What is this research about?
</h3> <p>
    23andMe is conducting research on pain. As part of this research, we are studying 
    how pain is perceived and tolerated by the body. To achieve this goal, we are asking 
    people to do an activity called the cold pressor test (CPT). This is a well-known and
    standard research activity in pain studies. The CPT subjects people to a mildly painful
    experience (submerging a hand in ice water) and monitors the development of their pain 
    response. The characteristics of the pain the CPT causes are very similar to those found 
    in individuals suffering from chronic pain, which makes this research activity a 
    straightforward way to look for factors that might affect the management or treatment of 
    physical, psychological, and/or chronic pain.
</p> <h3>
    Who can participate in this activity?
</h3> <p>
    You must be 18 years old to do this research activity. You must also be in good health. 
    You <b>MAY NOT</b> do this activity if you have any of the following:
</p> <ul>
   <li>
      High blood pressure
   </li>
   <li>
       Heart disease
   </li>
   <li>
       Dysrhythmia
   </li>
   <li>
       Any other cardiovascular disorder
   </li>
   <li>
       History of Raynaud's phenomenon
   </li>
   <li>
       History of fainting or seizures
   </li>
   <li>
       History of frostbite
   </li>
   <li>
       An open cut, sore or bone fracture on or near your non-dominant 
       hand (the one you do not usually write with)
   </li>
   <li>
       Any neurological disorder
   </li>
   <li>
       Are pregnant or think you might be pregnant
   </li>
</ul> </p> <p>
    If you have one of these conditions, this activity could make your condition worse or 
    cause you harm. You <b>MAY NOT</b> take part in this activity if you have any of these 
    conditions.
</p> <h3>
    What am I agreeing to if I consent?
</h3> <p>
    If you consent, we will ask you to place your hand in a container filled with ice water.
    You will be asked to keep your hand in the water as long as you can. We will ask you 
    questions about the activity and any pain you feel.
</p> <p>
    You can remove your hand from the ice water at any time. Your hand will not be in the
    water for more than 3 minutes.
</p> <p>
    You will receive a $10 gift card for your participation.
</p> <h3>
    What are the additional benefits or risks I should be aware of?
</h3> <h4>
    Additional Benefits
</h4> <p>
    There may be no direct benefit to you for participating in this study. However, 
    there may be some indirect benefits, including the following:
<ul>
   <li>
       Data from this activity could help scientists better understand 
       pain as well as a variety of medical conditions. Using this data, scientists could 
       develop new or improved treatments, medications, or therapies.
   </li>
   <li>
       While doing this activity, you may experience altruistic feelings.
       These may make you feel good about yourself or about helping others.
   </li>
</ul> </p> <h4>
    Additional Risks
</h4> <p>  <ul>
    <li>
        It is likely that you will feel numbness, tingling, burning, pain 
       or other unpleasant sensations in the hand you place in the ice water. For some people,
       this feeling could persist several minutes after completing the activity.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may feel light-headed or dizzy.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you spill or drip water onto an electronic device (such as your
       computer) while doing this activity, you could damage the electronic device.
    </li>
</ul> </p> <p>
    The following risks are very unlikely to happen, but you should be aware of them:
</p> <ul>
    <li>
        If you use wet electronic equipment, you could receive an electric shock or be electrocuted.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is possible that you could faint, which could result in a fall or other injury.
    </li>
</ul> <h3>
