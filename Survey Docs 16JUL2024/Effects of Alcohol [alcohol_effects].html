2024-07-16 10:52:16.498990<br><b>SURVEY TITLE:</b>  Effects of Alcohol<br><b>SURVEY DESCRIPTION:</b>  
We are interested in learning how genes influence how people respond to alcohol. This survey asks  questions about your responses at 3 different points in time. For these questions a drink is defined as 12 ounces of  beer, 1.5 ounces (or a shot) of 80 proof beverages (like vodka, whisky, or gin), or 5 ounces of most wines (a 750ml  bottle has about 5 standard drinks). <br><br>
Estimated time to complete: 3-5 minutes.

    This document serves as an addition to our general research consent form, and provides
    additional information specific to this particular survey. The general research consent
    form, which can be viewed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.23andme.com/about/consent">here</a>, includes a more complete summary of the risks and
    benefits of participating in our research.
</p> <p>
    The survey you are about to view is part of a research project to look for genetic
    correlates of the effects of alcohol. This topic may be highly personal and difficult to discuss.
    Answering some of the survey questions may cause emotional discomfort. In addition, scientific publication 
    of genetic associations with specific behaviors or personal characteristics may change the way those behaviors 
    or characteristics are perceived by the public. In some cases, such publication may affect the way you or groups 
    to which you belong are perceived. The survey will most likely take between 3 and 5 minutes to complete.
</p> <p>
    As described in our research consent form, your self-reported information (stripped of
    any personally identifying information) may be shared in aggregate with external
    organizations, but your individual information will never be shared with third parties
